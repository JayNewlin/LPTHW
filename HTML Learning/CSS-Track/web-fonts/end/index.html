			You've probably already heard of <a href="#">CSS preprocessors</a> by now, but haven't quite plucked up the courage to try one because of the learning curve, or maybe because &ldquo;preprocessor&rdquo; just plain sounds intimidating. So let's put those uncertainties at ease and go over what preprocessors are, how they work, and which one you might choose. In this article, we'll discuss the 3 most popular ones: <a href="#">Sass</a>, <a href="#">LESS</a> and <a href="#">Stylus</a>.

		<h2>What's a Preprocessor?</h2>
		<p>
			Preprocessors compile the CSS code we write in a processed language to the pure CSS syntax we're all used to. If you've recently considered using a CSS preprocessor, there's no better time to dive in with all the options and helpful tools available. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Until recently, there was a lot of resistance from developers who argued that preprocessors steered too far from pure CSS, added more layers of complexity and that &ldquo;If it's not broken, don't fix it.&rdquo; But lately, many have realized just how powerful preprocessors can make our CSS.
		</p>
		<h2>Why Use One?</h2>
		<p>
			There are various reasons why CSS preprocessors can be a valuable tool in our development process. First, they don't break browser compatibility; LESS, Sass and Stylus are all valid CSS and vice versa. Another advantage is preprocessors make our CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by allowing us to create <a href="#">variables</a> from reusable CSS properties, which makes our code more modular and scalable, so our CSS doesn't get out of hand and become difficult to manage&hellip;
