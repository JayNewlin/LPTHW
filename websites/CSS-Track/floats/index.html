    	<h4>Build a Simple Website</h4>
    	<p>Smells Like Bakin' is a cupcake company in need of a website. This project will walk us through the basics of HTML and CSS from the very beginning. HTML and CSS are the structural and presentational building blocks of every website and will serve as the foundation for any web project. The Smells Like Bakin' cupcake company needs their website to work on tablets and phones. We will modify the code of their pre-existing website so that it is flexible and fits beautifully into a wide variety of screen resolutions and devices.</p>
